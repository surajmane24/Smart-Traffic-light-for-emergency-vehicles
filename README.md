In modern life we have to face with many problems one of which is traffic
congestion becoming more serious day after day. It is said that the high volume
of vehicles, the inadequate infrastructure and the irrational distribution of the
development are main reasons for increasing traffic jam. The major cause leading
to traffic congestion is the high number of vehicles which was caused by the
population and the development of economy. Traffic congestion is a condition on
road networks that occurs as use increases, and is characterized by slower speeds,
longer trip times, and increased vehicular queuing. The most common example
is the physical use of roads by vehicles. When traffic demand is great enough that
the interaction between vehicles slows the speed of the traffic stream, these results
in some congestion.
As demand approaches the capacity of a road (or of the intersections along the
road), extreme traffic congestion sets in. When vehicles are fully stopped for
periods of time, this is colloquially known as a traffic jam or traffic snarl-up.
Traffic congestion can lead to drivers becoming frustrated and engaging in road
rage. In traffic environments, Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is used to regulate
traffic signs, warn the driver, and command or prohibit certain actions. A fast
real-time and robust automatic traffic sign detection and recognition can support
and disburden the driver, and thus, significantly increase driving safety and
comfort. Generally, traffic signs provide the driver various information for safe
and efficient navigation.
